## üë∑ Roadmap

- App with map view: This would allow users to see the locations of blood donation centers on a map, making it easier for them to find a location that is convenient for them.
- Search functionality: Users should be able to search for blood donation centers by location, such as by city or zip code.
- Filtering options: Users should be able to filter the list of blood donation centers by various criteria, such as by type of donation (whole blood, platelets, etc.), by location (e.g., within a certain distance of their current location), or by other factors such as age or weight requirements.
- Information about each location: The app should provide detailed information about each blood donation center, including its address, hours of operation, and any special requirements or restrictions.
- Appointments: Users should be able to schedule appointments to donate blood at a particular location, either through the app or by contacting the center directly.
- Notifications: The app could send users reminders about upcoming blood drives or other events, or alert them when there is an urgent need for blood donations in their area.
